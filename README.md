# OS MasterMap<sup>&reg;</sup> Highways Network Translator

### Introduction
This translator has been developed to convert OS MasterMap Highways Network data from its native GML into a variety of OGR supported output formats using Open Source tools.

<br>

### Requirements
[SAXON] - XSLT processor developed by Saxonica Limited<sup>&dagger;</sup>.

[Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)] - Translator library released by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation for reading/writing raster and vector geospatial data formats<sup>&dagger;&dagger;</sup>.

<sup>&dagger;</sup> Saxon 9.x requires Java 6 (also known as JDK 1.6) or later.
<sup>&dagger;&dagger;</sup> Process assumes GDAL/OGR 2.1.x release.

**`osmmHighwaysNetwork.xsl`**
Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) file used to transform GML files into a series of hash delimited staging files.

**`osmmHighwaysNetwork.awk`**
Restructures the hash delimited staging files into CSV format (including generation of cross-reference lookups).

**`userDefinedFunctions.awk`**
Reusable functions for geometry conversion; lookup handling; and vehicle/time qualification.

**`createVRT.awk`**
Generates the GDAL Virtual Format (VRT) files for onwards conversion of the CSV files.

**`schema.txt`**
Defines the data structure in the GDAL Virtual Format (VRT) files.
```c
product,member,geometryType
product,member,name,type,{length}
...
```

<br>

### Processing
The first stage (`process.sh`) transforms the GML files into CSV format. The output forms the basis for subsequent loading into PostgreSQL (using `ogr2ogr_CSV2PG.sh`) or GeoPackage (using `ogr2ogr_CSV2GPKG.sh`).

Environment variables in the shell script should be edited accordingly...

**`process.sh`**
```c
DATA_DIR='~/Documents/osdata/osmm-highways/_data'

OUT_DIR='~/Documents/osdata/osmm-highways/output'
TMP_DIR='~/Documents/osdata/osmm-highways/tmp'

XSLT_DIR='~/Documents/shared/tools'
JAVA_HEAP_SIZE=2048m

```

**`ogr2ogr_CSV2PG.sh`**
```c
OUT_DIR='~/Documents/osdata/osmm-highways/output'
TMP_DIR='~/Documents/osdata/osmm-highways/tmp'

GDAL_DIR='/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/Current/Programs'
PSQL_DIR='/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin'

```

To run...
```c
$ ./process.sh
$ ./ogr2ogr_CSV2PG.sh
```

The process takes ~3hrs to run on a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 MacBook Pro with 16 GB RAM.
